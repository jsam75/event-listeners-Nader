React Event Listener Exercises with Nader

These exercises were done before learning about Hooks or Component State.  The 3rd exercise is a contact form, which uses web API methods to extract data.  Nader showed 3 different methods of extraction, which was 
so helpful.  All 3 methods and notes are in the code.  I commented out 2 of the methods and left the 3rd method active.  It makes a table-like object, which I found neat.

I am leaving all 4 exercises (warmup + 3 exercises) in here so I can go back and reference and/or see my progress.  It's nice to leave a tangible trail of my coding journey.
